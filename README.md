# Haskell-programs
Personal repository for programs I wrote in Haskell. Feel free to use the Dockerfil;e as needed for creating the Haskell base image!

# Launch Docker devcontainer with dependencies 
Ensure you have `docker` properly installed on your system. Then launch the devcontainer in Visual 
Studio Code using the `Dockerfile` located in this directory to spawn an environment in which the necessary Haskell dependencies are installed.
